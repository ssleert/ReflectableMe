**Hi** there, if you're reading this, *you* probably found a *link* to my **blog** somewhere. <br>
Anyway I hope you **enjoy** reading my silly stuff.

*Actually* **I** would like to *call myself* a **programmer** or even *better* a **software engineer**
but **I** am too **lazy** to *develop* something *really* **useful** to other people. Now **I**'m *heavily*
into **computer science** and all this **stuff** about *writing* **programming languages**, 
**data transfer protocols**, all sorts of **asynchronous engines**, maybe **game engines**.

The **funny** *thing* is that **I** know a bunch of *different* **programming languages** and **technologies** but still *don't know* what to **develop** :(

~~Now **I** *reread* the **text** above and **realized** what **bullshit** **I** *wrote*.~~
